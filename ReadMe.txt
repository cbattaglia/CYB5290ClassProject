Setup Instructions:

1) This is a simple java project, as such all that is needed is to import it into an IDE such as Eclipse.

2) There are assumptions made for the Client-Server portion of this program which are:
	i) The client already has the Server's Public Key. As such, the 	client will access the servers public key by accessing the key 	within the folder itself
	
	NOTE: The server will receive the Client's Public Key as per the 	detailed steps we discussed in our Report.
	
	ii) The port for the Server and Client to connect to is hard coded 	into both. As said, this project is about our knowledge on PKI 	between server and client.
	
	iii) The accounts table stored on the server has only 5 accounts on 	it, so putting “REQUEST_BALANCE, 6” will not return anything. This 	is mainly to store some data and return it.
